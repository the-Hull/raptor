RAPTOR
======================

Performs wood cell anatomical data analyses on spatially explicit xylem (tracheids) datasets derived from wood anatomical thin sections. The package includes functions for the visualisation, alignment and detection of continuous tracheid radial file (defines as rows) and tracheid position within an annual ring of coniferous species. This package is designed to use elaborate cell output, like provided with ROXAS (von Arx & Carrer 2014). The package has been validated for Picea abies, Larix Siberica, Pinus cembra and Pinus sylvestris.
