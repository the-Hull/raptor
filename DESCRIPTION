Description: Performs wood cell anatomical data analyses on spatially explicit 
    xylem (tracheids) datasets derived from wood thin sections. The package 
    includes functions for visualisation, detection and alignment of continuous
    tracheid radial file (defined as rows) and individual tracheid position
    within an annual ring of coniferous species. This package is designed to be
    used with elaborate cell output, e.g. as provided with 
    ROXAS (von Arx & Carrer 2014). The package has been validated for Picea
    abies, Larix Siberica, Pinus cembra and Pinus sylvestris.
